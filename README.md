An app to help display a [captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal) browser to other devices on the network via DNS. Run this app on your computer, enter the DNS in the target device settings, and the captive portal should be displayed.

Based on [YourFriendlyDNS](https://github.com/softwareengineer1/YourFriendlyDNS/), which contains many more advanced options for other self-hosted DNS use cases.
