Support my work by sending me some Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash in the value of what you valued one or more of my software projects,
so I can keep bringing you great free and open software and continue to do so for a long time!
I'm going entirely 100% free software this year in 2018 (and onwards I want to) :)
Everything I make will be released under a free software license! That's my promise!
If you want to contact me another way besides through github, insert your message into the blockchain with a BCH/BTC UTXO! ^_^
Thank you for your support!
BCH: bitcoincash:qzh3knl0xeyrzrxm5paenewsmkm8r4t76glzxmzpqs
BTC: 1279WngWQUTV56UcTvzVAnNdR3Z7qb6R8j
(These are the payment methods I currently accept,
if you want to support me via another cryptocurrency let me know and I'll probably start accepting that one too)
